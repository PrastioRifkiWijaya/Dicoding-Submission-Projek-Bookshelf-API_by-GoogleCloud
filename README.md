## üéØ Class Description

Welcome to the **Bookshelf API** project! üåê  
Created by: **Dicoding Indonesia**  
Level: **Beginner**

## üöÄ Class Goals

This project aims to equip you with the skills and knowledge needed to become a successful **Back-End Developer**. By adhering to international standards set by Google Cloud, you will learn to build a **RESTful API** to support modern applications efficiently and effectively.

## üìö Course Content

#### 1. **Introduction to Back-End**

- **Duration**: 3 Hours 5 Minutes
- **Description**: Explains the role of front-end and back-end, how clients and servers communicate via HTTP protocol, and RESTful API architecture in building web services.

#### 2. **Node.js Basics for Back-End**

- **Duration**: 8 Hours
- **Description**: Get to know Node.js and learn the basics of Node.js such as global and process objects, modularization, Node Package Manager (NPM), eventing, filesystem, and stream techniques.

#### 3. **Building Web Services Using Node.js**

- **Duration**: 9 Hours 43 Minutes
- **Description**: Building Web Services using Node.js natively and through the Hapi framework, and building simple RESTful APIs.

#### 4. **Deploy Web Services**

- **Duration**: 3 Hours 15 Minutes
- **Description**: Get to know and use Google Compute Engine, operate Compute Engine instances via SSH, to run RESTful APIs on Compute Engine instances.

#### 5. **Consuming and Testing RESTful APIs Using Postman**

- **Duration**: 4 Hours 40 Minutes
- **Description**: Installing Postman. Consuming RESTful APIs for testing purposes and writing automated test scenarios using Postman.

## üèÅ Evaluation

- **Final Project**: The final project is a student practice in the form of a Bookshelf API, namely creating a Back-End from a notes application that has the **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** functions.

## ‚è∞ Total Duration

The total hours needed to complete this class, from class preparation to learning evaluation, are **45 hours**.

## üìã Criteria Met

1. **Application uses port 9000**: Ensure your app runs on port 9000. If needed, temporarily use another port but change it back for submission.
2. **Application starts with `npm run start`**: Include a start script in your `package.json`.
3. **API can save books**: Implement a POST route for saving book data.
4. **API can display all books**: Implement a GET route to return all stored books.
5. **API can display book details**: Implement a GET route to retrieve details of a specific book.
6. **API can update book data**: Implement a PUT route to update book details based on ID.
7. **API can delete a book**: Implement a DELETE route to remove a book based on ID.

## üåü Project Features

- CRUD functionalities for managing books.
- Unique ID generation for each book.
- Validation for request data.
- Responsive error handling for various scenarios.

## üíª Technology Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **Google Cloud Compute Engine**: Service for deploying applications.
- **Postman**: Tool for testing APIs.

## üì¶Version Runtime & Package Manager

- **Node.js**: 20.18.0
- **npm**: 10.8.2
- **Yarn**: 1.22.21
